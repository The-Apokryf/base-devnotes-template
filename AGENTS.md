## about content inside root project dir

let me split listin

### basic things

- _[AGENTS.md][AGENTS.md]_ - help to copilot
- _[journal-of-workflow][journal-of-workflow]_ - dailylog and scrapnotes store
- _[README.md][README.md]_ - everyone by default opening anything start here
- _[scafoldings][scafoldings]_ - notes templates
- _[visuals-of-flow][visuals-of-flow]_ - visualisations
- _[Taskfile.yml][Taskfile.yml]_ - wraps all defined tasks around the root object of project and any else stuff inside this craftbook

### toolkit armory management 

- _[pyproject.toml][pyproject.toml]_ - management of supportant python toolkiting
- _[package.json][package.json]_ - management of supportant javascript toolkiting
- _[compose.yaml][compose.yaml]_ - compact autonomical selfhosting orchestration recepie
- _[Dockerfile][Dockerfile]_ - base warp, scrap, indexing and else stuff machine preparation - yet on todo, no work been done here for now
- _[handler.py][handler.py]_ - entry declarator of python orchestration
- _[index.js][index.js]_ - entry declarator of js orchestration

### standard dependenties locking files

- _[uv.lock][uv.lock]_ - contains handled with UV python tool dependencies security locks
- _[package-lock.json][package-lock.json]_ - contains npm dependencies security locks for javascript _package.json_
- _[requirements.txt][requirements.txt]_ - export standard requirements locking from uv locking by task "`prepublish`" from _Taskfile.yml_ (this mean it is result after run command: `task prepublish`)
- _[pylock.toml][pylock.toml]_ - export toml pylock from uv locking by task "`prepublish`" from _[Taskfile.yml][Taskfile.yml]_ (this mean it is result after run command: `task prepublish`)

### repository management things and other 

- _[.dockerignore][.dockerignore]_ - ignore stuff while container making
- _[.git][.git]_ - dir that acts as container to all metadata of git repo
- _[.obsidianignore][.obsidianignore]_ - yet not ready but because of error or lack of developement one of plugins in obsidian responsible to hide unnececery files out of sight while writting docs - this with toolkit stuff in planned future will make it easy
- _[.gitmodules][.gitmodules]_ - git submodule declaration file
- _[.gitignore][.gitignore]_ - ignore stuff while git repo maintaining
- _[.husky][.husky]_ - scripts runned by listeners of npm package named husky binded with git hooks 
- _[.obsidian][.obsidian] - obsidian vault setup dir
- _[.python-version][.python-version] - uv pin on python version

### else common to been noticed after first lounch and then produced here

- _[node_modules][node_modules]_ - js environmential area included as selective ignorance target to be excluded
- _[.venv][.venv]_ - python environmential area included as selective ignorance target to be excluded
- _[.DRIVESET][.DRIVESET]_ - most of this dir's content is excluded of most selective ignorance files because of these subfolders there are volumes of docker containers that at most cases requires special care besause of required sizes, access speed or result export area
